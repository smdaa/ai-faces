## Description


<center> <img src="person.png" alt="drawing" width="350"/> </center>

This person does not exist; it was generated by altering features learned from this dataset : [A Century of Portraits](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~shiry/projects/yearbooks/yearbooks.html) by a convolutional autoencoder.

## Technical explanation
The convolutional autoencoder squeezes the higher dimensional space (171 x 186) through a lower dimensional bottleneck (64) by trying to reconstruct the original image

The PCA subspace of the lower dimension vectors is then calculated, and each knob corresponds to a bases vector. 

The most important feature seems to be background color, which makes sence because it takes a considerable part of the picture. The second most important feature is hair lenght / gender since both of them are kind of correlated. some other features control orientation and lighting and facial properties.

Sometimes, the result can be quite scary:
